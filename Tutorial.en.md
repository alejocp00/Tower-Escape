# Tutorial

## Player ðŸ§™

You are a slime trying to escape from the tower where you were captured. To do this, you have your magic and your ability to move and bounce off objects. To move sideways, you can use the **A** and **D** keys to move left and right respectively. If there is an enemy, you can shoot it by aiming with the mouse and clicking **left click**. Be careful not to fall into the lava ðŸ”¥

## Platforms

All the platforms have a random movement and when you jump on them you will get an impulse proportional to the level of the platform, which can be seen on the right side of it. If the boost is too high, you summon a protective shield to not take damage from enemies. There are 4 types of platforms:

### Enemy ðŸ’€

The enemies can be burning platforms or bats. When making contact on them, it is automatically lost unless you have a shield.

### Unstable   

You can jump over them up to a maximum of 3 times, depending on the state of the platform.

### Normal   

They are the standard platforms of the game.

### Frozen Enemy   

It is the result of having hit a shot against an enemy. Its behavior is identical to that of the Normal platform.

## Score ðŸ”¢

The score reflects how high you have reached, and we will always make sure that you see each of your failures to escape ðŸ˜€
